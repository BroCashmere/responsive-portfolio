      <p>Well, I won't back down,
          No, I won't back down,
          You can stand me up at the gates of hell,
          But I won't back down.</p>

      <p>No, I'll stand my ground,
          Won't be turned around,
          And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down,
          Gonna stand my ground,
          And I won't back down.</p>

      <p>I won't back down,
          Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out,
          I won't back down,
          Hey I will stand my ground,
          And I won't back down.</p>

      <p>Well I know what's right,
          I got just one life,
          In a world that keeps on pushin' me around,
          But I stand my ground,
          And I won't back down.</p>

      <p>I won't back down,
          Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out,
          I won't back down,
          Hey, I will stand my ground,
          And I won't back down,
          I won't back down.</p>

      <p>Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out,
          I won't back down,
          Hey, I will stand my ground,
          And I won't back down,
          No, I won't back down.</p>
